This project simulates the systems for a smart vending, and contains three sections. 
Section 1 contains the system for the vending machine itself where a customer can go, and buy snacks that are listed. To simulate money we incorporate buttons the user can add to their balance in order to perform transactions for testing. Section 2 is the system of the "Restock Tool" where the user can refill the inventory for the vending machine, based on the instruction that section is sent from the Management Tool (Section 3). Section 3 is the Management Tool, this system will manage the vending machine, and push restocks based on the current inventory, this system can also view the inventory of the vending machine at any time, and also view the purchase history for the vending machine.

As this is release 1 some issues remain, but are still in development. More functionalities will follow for the next release.
